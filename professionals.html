          As fellow practitioners, our commitment to providing a safe, affirming space is paramount. Yet, working effectively with Gender, Sexuality, and Relationship Diversity (GSRD) requires more than good intentions; it demands broad understanding and specialist knowledge. <br><br>My own professional journey has led me to bridge the gap between deep academic theory and practical, in-the-room clinical application. <br><br>My MSc in Gender Studies provides a robust framework for understanding the systemic and cultural forces impacting our clients, while my BACP-accredited clinical practice supported by in-depth GSRD training keeps that knowledge grounded in the reality of therapeutic work. This is a space where you can bring your clinical questions, your 'stuck' points, and even your fears without judgment. <br><br>My goal is to provide the specialist support that empowers you to move beyond basic competency and into a practice of deep, confident, and sustainable affirming care.
